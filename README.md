## My process

I like to work with Bootstrap components and combine them with Flexbox because it automatically lends itself to site responsiveness, without having to code responsiveness into the site.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I am good now with working with components but I still have a long way to go with layout.

### Continued development

I need to work on layout and definitely need to change to a more mobile-first approach since mobile browsing exceeds web browsing. Along with a mobile-first approach, I need to work on responsiveness and working with tools and frameworks that lends itself to coding responsive apps.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/) - This helped me with component layout
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This is an incredible resource for everything pertaining to CSS
